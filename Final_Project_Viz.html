      <h3>About Data:</h3>
      <p>The data is collected from <strong><em>Yahoo! Finance</em></strong> of four stocks during April 2017 to April 2018: Facebook(FB), Tesla(TSLA), Apple(AAPL), GoPro(GPRO). The variables selected are <strong>Date</strong>, <strong>Open</strong>, and <strong>Close</strong>.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>What is a "Stock"?</h3>
      <p>A stock is a type of security that signifies ownership in a corporation and represents a claim on part of the corporation's assets and earnings.</p>
      <p>There are two main types of stock: common and preferred. Common stock usually entitles the owner to vote at shareholders' meetings and to receive dividends. Preferred stock generally does not have voting rights, but has a higher claim on assets and earnings than the common shares. For example, owners of preferred stock receive dividends before common shareholders and have priority in the event that a company goes bankrupt and is liquidated.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>What is the "Opening Price"?</h3>
      <p>The opening price is the price at which a security first trades upon the opening of an exchange on a given trading day; for example, the New York Stock Exchange opens at precisely 9:30 a.m. Eastern. The price of the first trade for any listed stock is its daily opening price. A security's opening price is an important marker for that day's trading activity, especially for those interested in measuring short-term results such as day traders.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>What is the "Closing Price"?</h3>
      <p>The closing price is the final price at which a security is traded on a given trading day. The closing price represents the most up-to-date valuation of a security until trading commences again on the next trading day. Most financial instruments are traded after hours (although with markedly smaller volume and liquidity levels), so the closing price of a security may not match its after-hours price.</p>

      <h3>What you need to know about Facebook's data debacle</h3>
      <br>
      <p>What happens to the data you post on Facebook? And who's responsible for how those personal details are used?</p>
      <p>Facebook (FB) is under intense pressure to answer these questions — and more — after it admitted that a company linked to President Donald Trump's campaign had accessed and improperly stored a huge trove of its user data.</p>
      <p>The controversy erupted as UK media and The New York Times reported that data analysis firm Cambridge Analytica tried to influence how Americans voted using information gleaned from millions of Facebook profiles.</p>

      <p>The Model S has been lauded for its safety ratings, but news of this recall comes at a rough time for Tesla.</p>

      <h3>Apple's Stock Soars To Record Highs As iPhone X Hits Stores</h3>
      <br>
      <p>Apple shares raced to fresh highs on Friday after the company posted better-than-expected quarterly results and its highly anticipated iPhone X hit shelves.</p>
      <p>Shares added 3% in morning trading, opening at $174 apiece. That briefly gave the company a valuation of over $900 billion, solidifying its position as the world's most valuable company and putting a trillion-dollar valuation within sight.</p>
      <p>Investors have pushed the stock up nearly 50% this year, as excitement has built over the upcoming iPhone X and the company has come out with a string of blockbuster earnings reports. That marks a turnaround from 2016, when Apple's stock was plagued by China woes and lackluster iPhone sales.</p>

      <h3>GoPro shares fell 30% after it announced the end of its drone business, and it could be seeking a buyer.</h3>
      <br>
      <p>In a statement today, GoPro announced that it’s killing off its drone division and laying off 20 percent of its workforce. The camera-maker cited intense competition and future problems as the reason why it’s not going to make more drones after the Karma, its ill-fated first drone, failed to sell.</p>
      <p>The company has lowered the guidance for its next-quarter earnings, and founder and CEO Nick Woodman has reduced his salary to $1 for 2018, according to the statement, although other non-cash compensation remains.</p>

      <h3>News on Sep 25, 2017</h3>
      <h3>GoPro will launch the Hero 6 Black on September 28.</h3>
      <br>
      <p>GoPro announced today in an email that it’s holding a launch event this coming Thursday, September 28th, in San Francisco, California. While the company didn’t specifically name the new camera, all signs point to the new Hero 6 Black being the star of the show. CEO Nick Woodman will start things off at 9AM PT.</p>
      <p>It seems like the $499 Hero 6 will also go on sale that day, seeing as a number of the cameras have already been delivered to stores around North America, some of which were mistakenly displayed a few weeks too early. We’ll also probably learn more about the Fusion, GoPro’s consumer 360-degree camera, as well as updates to the Karma drone.</p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        According to the bar plot above, we can see for the period from April 2017 to April 2018, the stock price（accumulate prices of dates to the month）of Tesla is the highest one among four stocks; The stock price of GoPro is the lowest one; the stock prices of Facebook and Apple are in the middle, but the difference between them is not large. Note that the accumulated prices of April 2017 and April 2018 are much smaller than other months because we only extract dates from April 17 to April 30 of 2017, which is not the full month, so does April 2018.
